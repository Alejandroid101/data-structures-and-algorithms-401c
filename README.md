# Challenge Summary for ArrayShift(CH1)
I spent way too much time working on this. I ended up using a slightly different approach compared to what i did on the whiteboard

## Challenge Description
This challenge takes in an array and a number, and adds that number in the middle of the array

## Approach & Efficiency
I used an if statement to determine wheter the array has an even or odd number of elements. 
Then a for loop to iterate the new arraw and place the numbers in it

## Solution

# Challenge Summary for BinarySearch(CH2)
This is an application that takes an assorted array and a key value, iterates through it and returns the
index of the array if the element matches the key value.

## Challenge Description
It requires using BinarySearch and no language methods. The reads were very helpful.

## Approach & Efficiency
Did the reading provided in the challenge canvas page, started by using the floor and not ceiling option.
Used semantic variables and paid extra attention to whiteboard

# Challenge Summary for LinkedLists(CH5 and 6)
This challenge makes new nodes in 3 different way with 3 different methods.

## Challenge Description
1.-Append. Adds a new node to the end of the list
2.-insertBefore. Adds a new node before the target node(if the value exists)
3..insertAfter. Adds a new node after the target node(if the value exists)

## Approach & Efficiency
I struggled to make the logic work for this one, for a while I was not able to write the way it was supposed to.
