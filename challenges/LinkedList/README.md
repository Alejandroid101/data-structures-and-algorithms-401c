# Challenge Summary for LinkedLists(CH5, CH6 and CH7)
1.1 This challenge makes new nodes in 3 different way with 3 different methods. It also has 3 methods for: Insert, Includes and ToString
1.2 It now also has a sfunction that finds a node with a value that counts from the end back.
1.3 It now has 3 methods more methods of: Insert, Includes and ToString

## Challenge Description
1.-Append. Adds a new node to the end of the list
2.-insertBefore. Adds a new node before the target node(if the value exists)
3..insertAfter. Adds a new node after the target node(if the value exists)
4.-selectFromEnd. Given a value (k), use that value to find a node starting from the end of the list.
5.-Insert.- inserts a new node into the list.
6.- Includes.- Checks if a certain value is included in the list.
7.- ToStrong.- Turns all the values in a list into a string.

## Approach & Efficiency
The 3 main methods for challenge 5 are there but an unknown system IO error is being thrown. Cant figure it out
