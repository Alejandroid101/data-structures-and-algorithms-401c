# Challenge Summary for LinkedLists(CH5, CH6 and CH7)
1.1 This challenge makes new nodes in 3 different way with 3 different methods.
1.2 It now also has a sfunction that finds a node with a value that counts from the end back.

## Challenge Description
1.-Append. Adds a new node to the end of the list
2.-insertBefore. Adds a new node before the target node(if the value exists)
3..insertAfter. Adds a new node after the target node(if the value exists)
4.-selectFromEnd. Given a value (k), use that value to find a node starting from the end of the list.

## Approach & Efficiency
I struggled to make the logic work for this one, for a while I was not able to write the way it was supposed to.
