# Challenge Summary for ArrayShift(CH1)
I spent way too much time working on this. I ended up using a slightly different approach compared to what i did on the whiteboard

## Challenge Description
This challenge takes in an array and a number, and adds that number in the middle of the array

## Approach & Efficiency
I used an if statement to determine wheter the array has an even or odd number of elements. 
Then a for loop to iterate the new arraw and place the numbers in it

## Solution
