# Challenge Summary for Repeated Word(CH31)
Takes in a string and returns the first word that occurs more than once in the string.

-----
## Challenge Description
This applications will store the first word from a long string in a List, and then will compare the second word to the first. if it is the same,
will return the string, if it is not, then it will store it in the next position and will continue to do so until it finds a word that matches 
a word that already exists in the List.


------
## Approach & Efficiency
In this application I decided tu use a List because i can keep adding things without having to manually change the size.
i will nest an if statement in a for loop to check of the word exists in the list.
